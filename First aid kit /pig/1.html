<p class="c"> Career </p>
<p class="c1">
Pigs will find it hard to find jobs in 2019. They can, however, make a profit if they seek to do business. Working Pigs will have opportunities for promotion.
Although Pigs will align themselves with the jealous God of Age star (Tai Sui), someone will help them do business. In any emergency, friends around them will also be helpful.
</p>

<p class="ho"> Health </p>
<p class="ho1">
Pigs, especially working Pigs, should pay more attention to their health in 2019. Pigs who drive should always remember to obey the traffic rules. To avoid injuring others, they shouldn't drive after alcohol, or over the speed limit, or go through any red lights.
</p>

<p class="w"> Wealth </p>
<p class="w1"> In their zodiac year, Pigs may earn a lot of money. They should not, however, take part in gambling or risky ventures, or they will be deceived and lose money.

When pigs go to crowded places, they must take care of their belongings. In addition, when they go outside, they must make sure that electric appliances, stopcocks, gas taps, doors and windows at home are all turned off or closed, to avoid loss of or damage to property. </p>

<p class="l"> Love </p>
<p class="l1">
Male Pigs, whether single or married, will find it easy to attract members of the opposite sex around them. Good fortune smiles less on female Pigs.
