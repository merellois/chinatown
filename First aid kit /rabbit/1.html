<p class="c"> Career </p>
<p class="c1">
There will be unbelievable good luck for white-collar Rabbit workers who struggle in their jobs. Rabbits with professional skills and some specialized knowledge will be offered promotion and much experience will be accumulated.
If there is any juggling of jobs in the company, Rabbits will be well qualified and hopeful of seizing the opportunity to obtain promotion.
</p>

<p class="ho"> Health </p>
<p class="ho1">
Generally, Rabbits will enjoy decent health this year. They will participate in more outdoor activities. It will be advisable for them to join in physical exercise with family and friends, helping to enhance their own good health. At the same time, the people around them will get involved in sport.
</p>

<p class="w"> Wealth </p>
<p class="w1"> With good luck financially, Rabbits will earn a lot on their investments. If with the help of benefactors they seize new opportunities to develop, they will be rewarded with both money and luck. There will be unexpected income this year for Rabbits. </p>

<p class="l"> Love </p>
<p class="l1">
In their love lives, neither male nor female Rabbits will see much improvement. Chances of meeting the right one will be rare for them.
They should slow down. It takes time. A marriage is hard to achieve, but they still aspire to love at first sight. Single Rabbits should remain patient and seize whatever few opportunities arise during this period.
