<p class="c"> Career </p>
<p class="c1">
Many good opportunities will come the way of Roosters in 2019. At the same time, their good work may be recognized by their companies.
They should try to get along well with colleagues, to save effort in later cooperation.
</p>

<p class="ho"> Health </p>
<p class="ho1">
Roosters will experience generally bad health this year. Great attention should be paid to dietary hygiene and a well-balanced diet. They should do more exercise to build up resistance to illness. They should pay attention to safety when they are outside.
</p>

<p class="w"> Wealth </p>
<p class="w1"> Although much fortune will find its way to Roosters, they will still need to follow the rules, and not make risky investments. The major source of income for Roosters will be their salaries. Other investments or lottery gains will only contribute a little to their income. </p>

<p class="l"> Love </p>
<p class="l1">
Roosters are forecast to have an upturn in relational luck. They should be ready during the year to tie the nuptial knot.
