If they remember this, they'll be of much assistance.",
      "Tigers will have decent luck in month 11. They will be in a good mood because of rising financial fortune. They should think twice before making any decisions though. They shouldn't squander their years of accumulating money in a second. It is easier to make money than to save it.",
      "Tigers will keep their luck during month 12. They will handle their work seriously and complete it successfully. But they will have a hot temper as a result of the burden from work. Behaving rashly or harshly in the face of pressure will decrease their luck."

      "Luck will drop slightly for Dragons in Month 7, but generally things will go smoothly both at work and in life. They are advised to keep an eye on safety while traveling because of a possibility of being injured. A conflict with others might also occur in month 7.",
      "Dragons’ fortunes will continue to decline in Month 8. Further, they will experience failures and get stuck in doing only what they want to do. What really matters this month is to have good control of their moods.",
      "Month 9 is a time when Dragons fortunes will steadily rise. Being active is of great importance: the more they do, the more recognition and support they will win from others.",
      "Dragons will experience good luck in month 10 if they grasp the opportunities they have been longing for. Time will mostly be spent at work, but they will have a good rest at the end of month 10.",
      "Dragons will have stagnant luck in Month 11, when they will be exposed to a lot of scandals, which will call for a strong sense for judgment. What Dragons can do, is to try their best not to misunderstand others. More trust in others will win trust back.",
      "It will be a lucky month for Dragons in month 12 as they will have access to something new and will go through precious experiences. The effects will last long into the following year. It will be a time to relax and communicate with old friends."
